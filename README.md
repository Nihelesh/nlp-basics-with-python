# NLP Fundamentals – Hands-on Experiments

This repository contains my hands-on implementations of core Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, completed as part of my academic NLP laboratory coursework.

## What I Learned
Through these experiments, I gained practical understanding of:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Morphological analysis
- N-gram language models
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Chunking techniques
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Experiments Included
1. Text Preprocessing
2. Morphemes Analysis
3. N-gram Language Model
4. POS Tagging
5. Chunking Algorithm
6. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NLTK
- spaCy
- Pandas

## Note
These implementations are based on standard NLP laboratory exercises.  
I executed, tested, and analyzed the outputs using my own inputs to understand the concepts deeply.
